Unzip `pwn_sp_going_deeper.zip` to reveal a binary.

Putting the binary into [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) shows the password as `DRAEGER15th30n34nd0nly4dm1n15tr4t0R0fth15sp4c3cr4ft` as seen in the image below:

But since the `LF` char `(0x0a)` is taken into the input, `strncmp()` function call returns a non-zero result.

The exploit script is as follows; By terminating the string prematurely with a null byte, the `LF` char is not included and the `strncmp()` therefore returns `0`, giving us the flag.
