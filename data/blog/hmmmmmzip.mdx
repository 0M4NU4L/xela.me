We can see weird file sizes in the `out` directory:

![Out Directory](/static/images/hmmmmm-zip/1.png)

Extracting this shows `Unknown method`

![Extract error unknown method](/static/images/hmmmmm-zip/2.png)

Going into `hxd` shows bits and pieces of the flag in reverse order as seen below.

Final flag: `ictf{damn_you_did_it_314}`
