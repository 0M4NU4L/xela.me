## TL; DR

The binary reads the flag as a command line argument. An array of function pointers is used to invoke 43 different functions where each function checks a specific character in the flag.

## Solve

Another password-related binary again. In this binary, the password is the flag itself. The construction of the flag is rather simple but it first requires understanding some other aspects of the binary.

The binary consists of an [array of 43 function pointers](#array-of-function-pointers). All of them are invoked one after the other as seen [here](#excerpt-from-decompiled-code). Each function checks a specific byte in the memory and this process is repeated for 43 different bytes.

These 43 bytes are contiguously allocated on the memory from address `0x00303280` to `0x003032a9`. If you pay close attention to each functionâ€™s contents, you will notice that they are each checking for a specific character at a specific location within the previously mentioned range. For instance, `FUN_00101542` checks for if there is a `'c'` at address `0x003032a0` and `FUN_00101652` checks for a `'}'` at `0x003032aa`.

```c
if (DAT_003032aa == '}') {
                /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
longjmp((__jmp_buf_tag *)&DAT_003031a0,100);
}
```

As seen above, the function checks to see if there is a closing brace at the specified address. There are 42 other such functions that perform similar checks but at different addresses within a specific range. This range along with their designated characters will then form the flag we require.

From this observation, it is obvious that we must use these function checks to determine which character goes into which memory location. So from the above examples, we should assign a `'c'` to `0x003032a0` and assign `'}'` to `0x003032aa` which makes sense because this address is the last memory location in the range. After the characters have been assigned to their designated addresses, you will notice that they form a string of 43 bytes starting from a specific address and ending at another. This string is our flag.

The flag thus obtained is `HTB{h0pp1ng_thru_th3_sp4c3_t1m3_c0nt1nuum!}`
