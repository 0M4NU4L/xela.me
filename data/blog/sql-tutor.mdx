## Burpsuite

In the response part of the execute request, we can see debug is set to `null`

So we add a `debug=true` to our post params

This `true` value can also be seen in the js source code.

With `debug=true`, we can leak the signature and do the sql injection since the filtering phase is over.

![Compare Signature](/static/images/sqltutor/4.png)

Encode the payload in `base64` and get the sig. And then from here its a normal union injection.

![Flag](/static/images/sqltutor/8.png)

The flag is found under the `name` attribute of a user whose `id` is equal to 1:<br />`dctf {Pump_7h3_s7r3am_h4s5_up!_353aa965}`
