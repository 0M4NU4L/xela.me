## _I do a little coding, yes._

Heyo, my name is Samuel, but you know me as Mr_DJ or xelA on the internet. I am a developer that spends time coding scripts, building applications and creating websites. Been doing this for around 4 years now and still on the road to learn more.

Languages I know fairly well include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java 10, C, C++, C#, Python, Ruby and SQL.

I am a total cyber-security enthusiast. With the lockdown kickstarting my journey, I have been actively pwn-ing boxes on TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

This site is a collection of infosec related posts, including summaries/ walkthroughs of machines that I found interesting, and whatever else I decide to put on here.

See ya around, ta
